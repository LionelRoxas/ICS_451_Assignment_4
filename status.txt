# Status of Program

## Current State
The program is fully functional. Both the server and client components work as expected.

- Server: The server creates a socket, binds to a port, listens for connections, and sends the requested file when a client connects.
- Client: The client connects to the server, receives an HTTP response with headers and file content, and saves the file locally.

## Features Implemented
- Basic HTTP server that sends a file upon connection
- Simple HTTP client that receives and saves the file
- Proper HTTP header parsing in the client
- Informative output messages for each stage of the socket communication process
- Proper error handling
- Clean program termination

## Known Bugs/Limitations
- The server only handles one connection and then exits (as per assignment requirements)
- The server only sends the predefined file (server_file.html)
- Content-Type in the HTTP header is set to "text/html" by default and needs to be manually changed for other file types
- The client saves the file as "file_client.html" by default and should be modified for other file types

## Testing
The program has been tested on a UNIX environment. Both components compile and run without errors. The file transfer works correctly, and the client successfully saves the received file.
